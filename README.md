# MFE
Metabolic Flux Estimation model

* Here are the code and description of computational framework **MFE**.

* In this study, we have developed a computational framework for predicting the relative flux of a metabolite at the single-cell level by quantifying the differential expression levels of its producers and consumers from a population to multiple heterogenous subpopulations.
* MFE uses single-cell transcriptome data as input and, after scoring for neighbor missing values and gene expression ranking, predicts the relative flux level of each metabolite using a metabolic regulatory network we constructed. <br><br>
